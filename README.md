## What is this?
Welcome to the Karbon partners Obsidian notetaking setup. This includes the configurations and settings used by our
members to keep track of our ideas, meetings, notes, and projects.

## How do I use it?
1. Make sure you down load Obsidian to your machine! It is a very powerful note taking app that relies on simple markdown files!
2. Pick a location on your machine using a terminal
3. Clone the repository by using whatever cloning methods you prefer (HTTP will be the easiest)
4. Once the repository is cloned onto your local machine, open up obsidian and select "Open existing folder as a vault"
5. Open the cloned repository as a vault, and get to work!
